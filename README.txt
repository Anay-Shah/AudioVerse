MyAudio is an audio application designed to organize and manage various 
types of audio content, such as songs, audiobooks, and podcasts, all stored
in a central library. Users can download audio files from a simulated online
store to expand their collection. The app allows playback of content
(in this case, printing lyrics when a song is played) 
and supports creating custom playlists, which can feature songs or a combination
of different audio formats.
